2013 Measuring Broadband America Program
Mobile Measurement Android Application
Copyright (C) 2012  SamKnows Ltd.

The FCC Measuring Broadband America (MBA) Program's Mobile Measurement Effort developed in cooperation with SamKnows Ltd. and diverse stakeholders employs an client-server based anonymized data collection approach to gather broadband performance data in an open and transparent manner with the highest commitment to protecting participants privacy.  All data collected is thoroughly analyzed and processed prior to public release to ensure that subscribersâ€™ privacy interests are protected.

Data related to the radio characteristics of the handset, information about the handset type and operating system (OS) version, the GPS coordinates available from the handset at the time each test is run, the date and time of the observation, and the results of active test results are recorded on the handset in JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) nested data elements within flat files.  These JSON files are then transmitted to storage servers at periodic intervals after the completion of active test measurements.
